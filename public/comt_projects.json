Although the mean nitrogen budget of the Chesapeake Bay has been previously estimated from observations, uncertainties associated with interannually varying hydrological conditions remain. In this study, a land-estuarine-ocean biogeochemical modeling system is developed to quantify Chesapeake riverine nitrogen inputs, within-estuary nitrogen transformation processes and the ultimate export of nitrogen to the coastal ocean. Model skill was evaluated using extensive in situ and satellite-derived data, and a simulation using environmental conditions for 2001–2005 was conducted to quantify the Chesapeake Bay nitrogen budget. The five year simulation was characterized by large riverine inputs of nitrogen split roughly 60:40 between inorganic:organic components. Much of this was denitrified and buried within the estuarine system. A positive net annual ecosystemproduction for the bay further contributed to a large advective export of organic nitrogen to the shelf and negligible inorganic nitrogen export. Interannual variability was strong, particularly for the riverine nitrogen fluxes. In years with higher than average riverine nitrogen  inputs, most of this excess nitrogen (50–60%) was exported from the bay as organic nitrogen, with the remaining split between burial, denitrification, and inorganic export to the coastal ocean. In comparison to previous simulations using generic shelf biogeochemical model formulations inside the estuary, the estuarine biogeochemical model described here produced more realistic and significantly greater exports of organic nitrogen and lower exports of inorganic nitrogen to the shelf.</p><p><b>Collaborators:</b></p><p><b>Publications:</b></p><p><b>Datasets:</b><div class=\"list-group\"></div></p></div>",
            "model_desc": "<h3>Primary Chesapeake Bay Testbed models:</h3><h4 class=\"sub-project-title\">ChesROMS-SRM, ChesROMS -ECB, ChesROMS-BGC</h4><p>ChesROMS (<a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12237-011-9423-5\" target=\"_blank\">Xu et al. 2012</a>) is a community ocean modeling system for the Chesapeake Bay region, which is based on the Regional Ocean Modeling System (<a href=\"http://www.myroms.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ROMS</a>), with significant adaptations for the Chesapeake Bay. The model uses a curvilinear horizontal grid and a stretched terrain-following vertical grid with twenty vertical layers. The model was developed to provide a community modeling system for hindcasts, nowcasts and forecasts of 3D hydrodynamic circulation, temperature and salinity.</p><p>Multiple ecosystem/biogeochemical models have been coupled with ChesROMS. These include the Simple Respiration Model (SRM) which uses a constant respiration rate throughout the water column, as well as more sophisticated biogeochemical including including <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015JG002931/epdf\" target=\"_blank\">ChesROMS-ECB</a> and ChesROMS-BGC (see <a href=\"http://www.biogeosciences.net/13/2011/2016/\" target=\"blank\">Irby et al. 2016</a> for descriptions of these models.)</p><h4 class=\"sub-project-title\">CBOFS-SRM</h4><p>The ROMS-based Chesapeake Bay Operational Forecast System (CBOFS; Lanerolle et al., 2011) is the operational model run by the NOAA National Ocean Service. A major difference between ChesROMS and CBOFS is the horizontal grid resolution; ChesROMS has 100x150 cells with about 1 to 7 km resolution; CBOFS has 332x291 cells with about 0.03 to 4 km resolution. Results from CBOFS are available at: <a href=\"https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ofs/cbofs/cbofs.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ofs/cbofs/cbofs.html</a>. The Simple Respiration Model (SRM) has recently been coupled with CBOFS; these results are only available on a developmental version of the official CBOFS website.</p><h3>Additional Chesapeake Bay models:</h3><h4 class=\"sub-project-title\">ROMS-RCA</h4><p>Another ROMS-based model for the Chesapeake Bay has been independently developed and coupled to the Row-Column AESOP model (RCA; Testa et al., 2014). This version of ROMS (Li et al. 2005) is very similar to ChesROMS (including a similar horizontal resolution and number of vertical grid levels), but has slightly different hydrodynamic parameterizations and physical forcing.</p><h4 class=\"sub-project-title\">CH3D-ICM</h4><p>The Curvilinear Hydrodynamics in Three Dimensions model (CH3D; Cerco et al., 2010), is compared with the ChesROMS models described above in Irby et al. (2016). This model employs a z-grid and is used by the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program as part of their regulatory operational modeling framework. The horizontal grid of CH3D-ICM has significantly greater resolution than ChesROMS, and is more equivalent to that of CBOFS. CH3D is coupled to the Integrated Compartment Model (ICM), which is a complex biogeochemical modeling system.</p><h4 class=\"sub-project-title\">EFDC-SRM</h4><p>The Hydrodynamic-Eutrophication Model – Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) has been implemented for the Chesapeake Bay (Hong and Shen, 2012; Du and Shen, 2015), and also participated in the Chesapeake Bay Hypoxia Testbed comparison (Irby et al. 2016). The EFDC implementation used here is coupled to a version of the Simple Respiration Model (SRM).</p><h4 class=\"sub-project-title\">FVCOM-ICM</h4><p>The ChesROMS models were also compared with the Finite-Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM; Jiang and Xia, 2015). FVCOM employs an unstructured grid with ten vertical layers. Like CH3D, FVCOM is coupled to the ICM.</p>",

                "text": "<p>Hypoxia is a condition threatening the health of the Chesapeake Bay in which oxygen levels drop so low that fish and other animals are stressed or killed.  In the Bay, incidents of hypoxia-causing ‘dead zones’ are on the rise.</p><p>Hypoxia in Chesapeake Bay usually occurs in the summer and is primarily the result of human activities that deliver nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus into the Bay, although evidence from the testbed scientists suggest that wind forcing also plays a significant role. The added nutrients support surface blooms of algae, which eventually die, sink and are decomposed at the bottom of the Bay by oxygen-depleting bacteria. The resulting hypoxia can suffocate animals that cannot move away, such as shellfish, and — depending on how quickly the hypoxia develops — either kill or force into less suitable habitat free-swimming animals such as fish and crabs.</p><p>The Chesapeake Bay Testbed project is designed to provide a better understanding of the uncertainty inherent in predictions of properties such as salinity, temperature, chlorophyll, and nutrients; how this uncertainty contributes to the predictability of dissolved oxygen concentrations; and how to improve models of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in the Chesapeake Bay. Model intercomparisons have demonstrated that the regulatory model used by the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program performs as well as many of the research models currently being used by the scientific community, giving both Chesapeake Bay Program Managers and academic scientists more confidence in the regulatory model. An ensemble mean of multiple models was found to have higher skill predicting hypoxia than any individual model (<a href=\"http://www.biogeosciences.net/13/2011/2016/\" target=\"_blank\">Irby et al., 2016</a>), illustrating the potential value of multi-model ensembles for decision making in the Chesapeake Bay.</p><p>A simple one-term model for hypoxia was developed for use in operational forecasts and is currently providing nowcasts and 2-day forecasts of Chesapeake Bay hypoxia on the <a href=\"http://www.vims.edu/research/topics/dead_zones/forecasts/cbay/\" target=\"_blank\">Virginia Institute of Marine Science website</a>. Forecasts from more sophisticated hypoxia models are in the developmental stage and will soon also be available on this website, along with other fields relevant to Chesapeake stakeholders (temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, water clarity). Efforts to transition this tool to NOAA’s <a href=\"https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ofs/cbofs/cbofs.html\" target=\"_blank\">Chesapeake Bay Operational Forecast System (CBOFS)</a> and to the <a href=\"http://oceansmap.maracoos.org/\" target=\"_blank\">IOOS Mid-Atlantic Regional Association (MARACOOS) OceansMap</a> are ongoing. In a companion effort, the Chesapeake Hypoxia Testbed team has used multiple models to examine how nutrient load reductions will impact dissolved oxygen in the Chesapeake Bay, and has developed a method for quantifying the uncertainty associated with projected changes in hypoxia resulting from the implementation of these nutrient reductions. Ongoing work is focused on applying projected changes in temperature, freshwater flow, and sea level rise for a 2050 scenario to explore the impact climate change may have on future Chesapeake Bay hypoxia and the potential success of the nutrient reductions in attaining mandated estuarine water quality standards.</p><p>The results of this project are providing the modeling information that will enable best management practices and mitigation measures to be targeted on the human activities that have the most significant effect on decreasing nutrient transfer from land to coastal ecosystems in the region. Recent findings include (1) that the ChesROMS-1term model performs just as well when using nowcast forcing as it does when using hindcast forcing, (2) that ignoring precipitation/evaporation and underestimating riverine freshwater inputs may be causing a high salinity bias in the official version of CBOFS, (3) that nutrient load reduction scenarios conducted with both the regulatory EPA model and our ChesROMS-BGC research model confirm that both models predict similar improvements in bottom DO, and nearly identical water quality standards attainment, (4) the transition of the HYPOXIA_SRM (simple respiration model) to the official ROMS Ecosystem Branch.

Results will inform the interagency Hypoxia Task Force’s efforts to devise near-term and long-term nutrient management strategies. Open questions for nutrient management in the watershed are how far nutrient loads would have to be decreased in order to produce the significant reductions in Gulf of Mexico hypoxia, when these would be measurable given significant natural variability, and how global warming will affect the management goals. We have quantified the effects of differential reductions in river N and P loads on hypoxic extent. An assessment of the effects of N versus P reductions is important because, thus far, nutrient management efforts have focused on N, yet P is known to limit primary production in spring and early summer. Our results indicate that while N is the ‘ultimate’ limiting nutrient to primary production, temporary P limitation in spring plays a large role in determining areal hypoxic extent and cumulative hypoxic exposure. Reductions in either river N or P load would decrease hypoxic extent but combined reductions of N and P would have the greatest effect.</p><p><b>Collaborators:</b> Katja Fennel (Dalhousie), Arnaud Laurent (Dalhousie), Dong S.

Project objectives are to: (1) compile a data set of observations collected around Puerto Rico and the USVI by the IOOS Caribbean Regional Association; (2) evaluate multiple, coupled wave/surge/inundation models against this data; (3) recommend the most suitable model for transition to operations and (4) assist with the transition.  These outcomes will also be applicable to U.S. island regions in the Pacific and may therefore guide future implementations at NOAA’s Central Pacific Hurricane Center.</p><p>U.S. island regions in the Caribbean and Pacific pose many challenges to the accurate modeling and prediction of hazardous wave-dominated storm surge inundation events.  The relative importance of physical processes leading to inundation in steep-sloped, reef-edged island environments differs from those in milder-sloped mainland environments.  Relatively little research has been done in these environments, constituting a significant knowledge gap.  To compound this uncertainty, little observational data are available in many island environments.  As a result, the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) currently lacks operational surge and inundation guidance for these regions. An exception to this general data scarcity is Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI), which frequently experience strong tropical and extra-tropical storms resulting in high waves, storm surge, and river flooding.  A large number of observational instruments have been deployed here, many by IOOS Caribbean Regional Association partners, creating a valuable resource for the evaluation and advancement of operational wave/surge/inundation models of these areas.</p><p>Three teams – an operational assessment team (federal user group), a numerical modeling team and a data management team – will work together to accomplish the following tasks:\nModel, test case and metric selection: All teams jointly define desired operational inundation model improvements in Puerto Rico and USVI, and identify candidate models to meet those needs.  The data team selects test cases for model evaluation and compiles these into an islands inundation data set, compliant with the COMT’s Cyber-Infrastructure standards.  All teams jointly define a set of metrics for model evaluation and comparison.</p><p>Model comparison over reef transects: The modeling team performs detailed cross-reef simulations with coupled spectral wave and hydrodynamic models to evaluate performance on a physics process basis.  Results are compared with observations and against phase-resolving wave models (which are too expensive for operational use, but will provide useful benchmark results).</p><p>Model comparison for regional field cases:  The modeling team performs model evaluations over complex regional field cases, featuring hurricane meteorological forcing, high-resolution bathymetry and topography, roughness values derived from benthic maps and rainfall run-off inputs.  Model performance will be compared for accuracy and computational requirements.</p><p>Final evaluation, recommendations and dissemination: All teams will compile joint recommendations regarding the most suitable model or models for near-term and long-term operational implementation.  Recommendations will also be made regarding current and future observational networks and field campaigns.  All teams will provide assistance in the transition of the recommended model, incl. setting up COMET web-based training materials, if required.</p>"

Wave-current interaction created variations in the surge elevation in both space and time, with the more significant effects occurring over the shelf and open coast rather than inside the inner bays. Sea level change along the coast was mainly driven by barotropic dynamics; the highest vertically integrated water transports were essentially the same for cases with and without vertical stratification. However, wave-current interaction generated strong vertical current shear in some of the stratified areas, leading to a strong offshore transport near the bottom and vertical turbulent mixing over the continental shelf. Stratification could also result in a significant difference in current velocities around islands where the water is not vertically well-mixed.</p><p><b>Publications: </b>Yunfang Sun, Changsheng Chen, Robert C.

All three models showed comparable tidal accuracy and consistent dynamic responses to storm winds, both with and without the inclusion of wave effects. The three models also showed that wave-current interaction could (1) change the current direction on the shelf to the north of Scituate Harbor from along-shelf to onshore, thereby enlarging onshore water transport and (2) intensify an anticyclonic eddy in the harbor entrance and a cyclonic eddy in the harbor interior, which could push water inside the harbor toward the northern peninsula and the southern end and thus enhance flooding in those areas.</p><p><b>Publications: </b>Changsheng Chen, Robert C.

In all simulations, a wind driven coastal current flowed southward across the harbor entrance, with an attached separation eddy forming downstream of the northern breakwater and a rapid decrease of wave energy entering the harbor. With wave-current interaction, the southward coastal current was strongly enhanced and currents within the separation eddy increased to more than 1 m/s, making it highly nonlinear with large lateral shears. Comparisons of the model water elevation time series with harbor tide station measurements showed that wave-current interaction increased the peak model surge by ∼8 cm, in closer agreement with the observed peak.

The default/recommended setting for the wind input parameterization overestimated the maximum significant wave heights by about 2 m in the deep Gulf of Mexico when compared with observations from moorings. The overestimation could be relieved either by adjusting the maximum value of the surface drag coefficient or by substituting a high-wind-speed bulk formula for the default low-to-moderate one used in SWAN. Because of the dissipative effects of the shallow coastal areas, the overestimation of waves in deep water has limited impact on the waves in near-shore waters. Thus, previous wave model results using a low-to-moderate wind speed bulk formula may still be reliable in waters shallower than 20 m while overestimating significant wave heights in deeper waters for high wind speed conditions such as hurricanes.</p><p><b>Publications: </b>Huang, Y., R.H.

However, its large wind field in conjunction with the broad Louisiana-Texas shelf and large-scale concave coastal geometry generated waves and surge that impacted over 1000 km of coastline. Ike's complex and varied wave and surge response included: the development of a storm surge “forerunner” 24 h prior to the storm's landfall due to strong shore-parallel, wind-driven currents and the associated across-shelf, geostrophic setup; the resulting early rise of water in coastal bays and lakes facilitating inland surge penetration and inundation; the shore-normal wind-driven peak surge; the southward propagation of a free wave along the Texas shelf; and the appearance of resonant and reflected waves on the adjacent continental shelf. Preexisting and rapidly deployed instrumentation provided the most comprehensive hurricane response data set ever recorded. More than 91 wave parameter time histories, 523 water level time histories, and 206 high water marks were collected in deep water, in the near shore, and up to 65km inland.

Grid resolution requirements were found to be less stringent in the open ocean, however, coarse resolution or the absence of intratidal zones decreased solution accuracy along protected near shore and inland coastal areas due to decreased frictional attenuation. Diurnal tidal amplitudes were more sensitive to the presence of intratidal zones and coarse mesh resolution than semidiurnal tides. The bottom friction parameterization had little effect on tidal skill, however, it had a significant impact on the strength of the alongshore current generated during hurricane Ike and the magnitude of the resulting geostrophic setup (forerunner). Nonlinear advection increased the geostrophic set up by 15–20 cm and increased resonant shelf waves by 20–30 cm.

In addition, NWS's official operational forecast storm surge model, SLOSH, was used on both local (Galveston and Sabine Pass basins) and Gulf of Mexico (ETSS) grids. The three unstructured models yielded similar results for both hurricanes. These models all appeared to reproduce the important physical processes, showed minimal water level or wave height bias, and comparable variances versus observations. SLOSH using the Galveston Basin grid failed to capture the hurricane Ike forerunner and was therefore biased significantly low. SLOSH performed better on the Sabine Pass Basin grid for hurricane Rita, which did not elicit a significant forerunner. SLOSH on the ETSS grid showed minimal bias for either storm, although its accuracy was limited by the nearly 5 km resolution in near shore/onshore areas. In all cases, SLOSH deviations from observations were greater than those from the three unstructured grid models. The largest difference in model performance was observed in execution speed and scalability. The implicit time stepping scheme of SELFE+WWM performed well at small numbers of cores, but scaled poorly at larger numbers of cores. ADCIRC+SWAN had better scaling and absolute performance when more than 128 cores were used per run. SLOSH is not configured to utilize modern parallel computing architecture and rather is limited to running on a single core. Runtimes for ADCIRC on a single core were more than 10 times longer than for SLOSH on the ETSS grid, even after the SLOSH runtimes were normalize for the number of grid nodes. Thus, SLOSH remains more efficient for use in probabilistic forecasting based on large ensembles of model runs. However, SLOSH-based probabilistic forecasts should be assessed for accuracy (particularly high or low bias) by comparing select, individual SLOSH runs with similar runs using higher resolution unstructured grid models as presented herein.</p><p><b>Publications: </b>Kerr, P.

            "model_desc": "<h3>ADCIRC:</h3><p>ADCIRC is a widely used coastal circulation and storm surge model (see a partial list of ADCIRC publications at http://adcirc.org) that solves the 2D or 3D shallow water equations on a triangle-based unstructured grid to enable coverage of large domains and complex geometry, topography and bathymetry in the Coastal Zone. Forcing includes tides, meteorological fields and rivers, and it simulates wetting and drying of areas subject to transient flooding. It has been highly parallelized using domain decomposition for efficient application on high performance computers (Dietrich et al, 2012). Following Hurricane Katrina (2005), ADCIRC was coupled with the unstructured grid version of the SWAN wave model (Ziljema, 2010) to create a modeling system often called ADCIRC+SWAN (or often just ADCIRC) that provides a seamless solution to tides, surge and waves (Bunya et al, 2010; Dietrich et al, 2010; Dietrich et al, 2011). ADCIRC has also been coupled to the US Army Corps of Engineers ST-WAVE model via the Coastal Storm Modeling System (CSTORM-MS, Massey et al, 2011) and is currently being coupling to the unstructured version of its WaveWatch III wave model (A. van der Westhuysen, NOAA NWS/EMC personal communication). ADCIRC has been used to provide surge and wave conditions to delineate coastal flood hazards for the FEMA National Flood Insurance Program from New England to Texas, to evaluate flood hazards at coastal nuclear power plants for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, to design coastal flood reduction systems (e.g., levees, flood walls) around major coastal cities including New Orleans (USACE, 2012), Houston/Galveston and New York City (Bloomberg, 2013). It is one of NOAA’s core coastal models and is the basis of NOAA’s V-DATUM program as well as the ESTOFS and HSOFS operational models. A previous pilot project associated with NOAA’s CI-Flow program demonstrated that output from NOAA’s Distributed Hydrology Model (HL-RDHM) could be used as a real time input to ADCIRC in eastern North Carolina (Van Cooten et al, 2011; Dresback et al, 2013) although the ADCIRC triangular grids restricted the allowable model time step and therefore the effectiveness of the application. By overcoming this limitation, ADCIRC may be an attractive hydrodynamic solution in the Middle Zone since it would simply be an extension of (and thus seamlessly integrate with) the operational ESTOFS / HSOFS models.</p><h3>D-Flow:</h3><p>NOAA’s Office of Water Prediction has recently begun working with the D-Flow Flexible Mesh (FM) model (H. Mashriqui, NOAA OWP, personal communication). D-Flow is the hydrodynamic component of the DELFT-3D hydro-morphological modeling suite used to simulate non-steady flows and transport in 1D, 2D or 3D, (Deltares, 2014). Forcing includes tides meteorological fields and rivers, and it simulates the wetting and drying for flooding computations. The original D-Flow solves the shallow water equations on either a rectilinear or curvilinear, boundary fitted mesh while the more recently developed D-Flow FM uses an unstructured, flexible mesh of triangles, quadrilaterals and / or hexagons. D-Flow FM has a finite volume numerical algorithm with a higher-order advection treatment that is better suited for advection dominated supercritical flows, bores and dam breaks than ADCIRC’s finite element algorithm. D-Flow FM is parallelized for high performance computing, using a domain decomposition approach similar to ADCIRC and using OpenMP. D-Flow FM may therefore be an attractive option in the Middle Zone provided an effective coupling can be developed with ESTOFS / HSOFS. The overall DELFT-3D package has been widely applied in coastal, river and estuarine areas for water flows sediment transport, waves, water quality, morphological developments and ecology. In 2011, the D-Flow curvilinear grid model was open-sourced. D-Flow FM is currently limited to a small group of development partners, but Deltares anticipates having D-Flow FM fully open source in late 2018. Given that NOAA is already using 2 D-Flow FM, the actual open source release date should not constrain its use in this COMT project.</p><h3>GSSHA:</h3><p>GSSHA (Gridded Surface/Subsurface Hydrologic Analysis - Downer and Ogden, 2004) is a two-dimensional, physically-based watershed model that simulates surface water and groundwater hydrology, erosion and sediment transport. It has been developed at the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center Hydraulic Modeling Branch and is approved for use for determining hazards from hydrologic flooding for the FEMA National Flood Insurance Program. GSSHA solves the diffusive wave approximation to the shallow water equations, that neglects transient terms in the momentum equation. A finite volume numerical solver is used on a regular square grid spatial discretization of the watershed with elevation data extracted from a digital elevation model. GSSHA can represent various hydraulic structures such as weirs, culverts, detention basins, etc, and includes a vector channel algorithm allowing channels to flow in any direction independent from the grid resolution. GSSHA models a large number of processes including precipitation distribution, snowfall accumulation and melting, infiltration, evapotranspiration, surface runoff routing, channel flow routing, unsaturated zone flow, saturated groundwater flow, overland sediment erosion, transport and deposition, and channel routing of sediments. GSSHA provides the capability to explicitly model precipitation input and hydrologic processes in the Middle Zone, versus simply routing water from the Upland or Coastal Zone across the Middle Zone by ADCIRC and D-Flow. Due to the low slope topography along much of the US coast (particularly the Gulf and SE Atlantic coasts) the width of the Middle Zone may be significant, and therefore including hydrologic processes in this zone may be important. On the other hand, the use of the diffusive wave approximation in rivers subject to tidal influence and upstream surge propagation is probably not adequate, thereby requiring a combination of ADCIRC / D-FLOW and GSSHA in the Middle Zone. Including GSSHA in this COMT project provides the opportunity to determine the data flows required to include GSSHA or a similar model of the Middle Zone hydrology and evaluate its value for inclusion as part of the Middle Zone solution.</p><h4>References</h4><p><a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/sirr/html/report/report.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg, M.

            "model_desc": "<h3>NECOFS:</h3><p>NECOFS is an integrated regional atmosphere/surface wave/ocean forecast model system, covering the Delaware Shelf to the eastern end of the Scotian Shelf. NERACOOS and IOOS have supported the operations and improvement of NECOFS since 2007. The present system includes: 1) a community mesoscale meteorological model, Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF); 2) the 4th regional version of the Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (GOM4-FVCOM); 3) the unstructured-grid surface wave model (GOM4-SWAVE) modified from SWAN (Qi et al., 2009); 4) the Massachusetts (Mass) Coastal FVCOM with the inclusion of estuaries, inlets, harbors and intertidal wetlands; and 5) four subdomain wave-current coupled FVCOM inundation forecast systems in Scituate and Boston Harbor, MA; Hampton-Seabrook Estuary, NH, and Saco Bay, ME (Figure 1).</p><img class='img-responsive img-thumbnail' src='/images/comt/necofs-new-img.png' /><p class='caption'>Figure 1. Schematic chart of the NERACOOS supported Northeast Coastal Ocean Forecast System (NECOFS).</p><p>NECOFS is forced by 1) the surface wind, wind stress, heat flux and precipitation minus evaporation flux; 2) measured river discharge along the coastal boundary; 3) surface waves and tides along the ocean boundary; 4) the inflow of the cool and lower salinity water from the upstream Scotian Shelf; and 5) along the outer ocean boundary by the Global-FVCOM, which allows the interaction with the Gulf Stream as well as data assimilation of SST, SSH and T/S profiles for the NECOFS domain covering the entire Northeast coastal region.</p><p>As an initial component of a state-of-the art “end-to-end” model forecast system for NERACOOS, NECOFS was placed in experimental forecast operation in late 2007, making daily experimental three-day forecast of surface winds, air pressure, precipitation via evaporation, wintertime icing, water elevation, 3-D water currents, water temperature and salinity, significant wave height/frequency, and storm-induced coastal inundation for the Northeast US coastal region. The forecast operation was carried out daily with an updated initial condition that is determined by the three-day backward hindcast or nowcast data assimilation. The data used in the data assimilation includes satellite SST and radiation, river discharge, NOAA C-MAN and NDBC buoys, and NERACOOS buoys. A web-based mapping application was developed to display the NECOFS forecast products (via WMS services) for public use, which can be accessed at the address: http://134.88.228.119:8080/fvcomwms/. Additionally, NECOFS data are accessible via web services from a THREDDS Data Server (TDS) housed at University of Massachusetts – Dartmouth (UMassD) and integrated into several NERACOOS.org data products, including a model/observation comparison tool and a recently developed coastal flood forecast tool.</p><p>The present version of NECOFS has two versions: 1) forecast version, and 2) hindcast version. Both forecast and hindcast versions use the same regional domain grid, but the forecast version does not include the nesting boundary with global models and has a maximum water depth of 1500 m. The hindcast version is a global-regional nested system with the boundary conditions provided by Global-FVCOM.</p><p>Hindcasts produced by NECOFS successfully capture the spatial and temporal variability of the physical field in the region including: vertical mixing and subtidal currents (Cowles et al., 2008); tidal elevations/currents (Chen et al., 2011); water stratification (Li et al., 2015); CODAR-derived surface currents (Sun et al., 2016); and the upstream region in the Arctic Ocean (Chen et al. 2016, Zhang et al., 2016a,b).</p><p>The current NECOFS system is at a Readiness Level (RL) of 7, since it has been demonstrated in an operational environment. This project will advance NECOFS to a RL of 9 for the Northeast Region. However, one of the main focus areas of this project is to upgrade various components of NECOFS that are currently at a RL of 4-5 to a RL of 7-8. The Finite Volume Community Ocean Model Community (FVCOM), at the core of NECOFS, has been developed and upgraded by the UMassD team since 1999 (Chen et al., 2003, 2006, 2013). It features unstructured triangular meshes with horizontal resolution of ~ 0.1-25 km and a hybrid terrain-following vertical coordinates. The most recent version of FVCOM (version-4) is a fully coupled current-ice-wave-sediment-ecosystem model system. FVCOM version-5 is in development and currently at a RL of 5, since it has undergone successful evaluation in a relevant environment. This project will advance FVCOM version-5 to a RL of 8.</p><p>Global-FVCOM is a fully atmosphere-ice-surface wave-ocean coupled primitive equation unstructured-grid ocean model that was also developed by UMassD. Global FVCOM is driven by astronomical tidal forcing with eight constituents (M2, S2, N2, K2, K1, P1, O1 and Q1); surface wind stress; net heat flux at the surface plus shortwave irradiance in the water column; surface air pressure gradients; precipitation (P) minus evaporation (E); and river discharge (Gao et al., 2011, Chen et al., 2016). The updated version of Global-FVCOM features a horizontal resolution of ~2 km (measured by the length of the longest edge of a triangular cell) within the Canadian Archipelago, shelf-break and coastal regions to ~50 km in the interior open ocean. The vertical grid features a total of 45 layers (Chen et al., 2009, 2016). In shelf and coastal regions of depth less than 225 m, a sigma distribution with a uniform layer thickness is used. The coordinate transition thus occurs smoothly at a depth of 225 m, where all layers have a uniform thickness of 5 m.</p><h3>The Advanced Research Weather Research Forecast model (ARW-WRF):</h3><p>With support from the NOAA Cooperative Institute for the North Atlantic Region, in the wake of the Sandy Superstorm, the present version of NECOFS was used to examine the influence of oceanic mixed layer (OML) dynamics, cumulus parameterization, atmospheric planetary boundary layer schemes, grid design/resolution on intensity, pathway and landfall of Hurricane Sandy (Li et al., 2017). Including the OML parameterization was shown to significantly improve the accuracy of the simulated hurricane pathway and the intensity of the minimum central sea level pressure. OML parameterization was included in NECOFS through coupling the Advanced Research Weather Forecast model (ARW-WRF) into NECOFS and conducting the hurricane simulation for the cases with and without coupling of the OML. The reality and accuracy of hurricane path and intensity were also found to be relevant to the design and resolution of the two-way nested grid. To improve the NECOFS’ capability for hurricane forecast and storm induced coastal inundation, it is necessary to upgrade the NECOFS into a fully coupled atmospheric-oceanic model system. Improving the domain covering the region of the early development stage of the hurricane and grid refinement in the coastal region could also improve the simulation results of hurricane center pathway, timing and intensity. The NECOFS with the AWR-WRF has undergone successful evaluation in an experimental environment and is at a RL of 4.</p><h3>Extended and higher Resolution Domain - GOM5-FVCOM</h3><p>An expanded and higher resolution grid domain, GOM5-FVCOM, has been developed with a southward extended domain to Cape Hatteras. The new grid domain will improve the ability to investigate coastal inundation, as well as provide an increased understanding of changes in the connectivity of the fish larvae recruitment, coastal acidification, and ecosystems over the entire Northeast coastal ocean. The GOM5-FVCOM domain has undergone successful evaluation in relevant environment through testing and prototyping and is at a RL of 5.</p><h4>References</h4><p>Chen, C., H. Liu, and R.

                "text": "<p>In the last decade, IOOS has made remarkable progress toward an interoperable framework for working with ocean forecast model data. Providers deliver data via community standard OPeNDAP services using Climate and Forecast (CF) metadata conventions, and developers then use standard libraries to build applications that will work with any structured grid model (e.g. ROMS, NCOM, HYCOM, Delft3D) without the need to write any model-specific code. An outstanding gap, however, is the ability to fully support unstructured grid (e.g. triangular mesh) models, which are now being used throughout IOOS for both inundation and full 3D operational ocean forecasts.</p><p>The need for better tools to work with unstructured grids has been apparent for some time: In 2006, NOAA and NSF co-sponsored a workshop, “Community Standards for Unstructured Grids,” which was attended by 30 representatives from academic, government, and commercial organizations. The consensus statement of the workshop was “The unstructured ocean model community should define a data model (in the language of OPeNDAP) and ensure the mapping of that model onto netCDF3 and HDF5 is functional”. The community subsequently developed the UGRID Conventions, which extend the CF metadata conventions to describe unstructured grid model output. It remains to embed these standards into the services most commonly used by the IOOS community.</p><p>While IOOS-supported services can be delivered and consumed by a variety of software components, Unidata’s THREDDS Data Server (TDS) is the most widely used in IOOS. The TDS not only provides OPeNDAP access, but provides the OGC Web Map Service to create maps and NetCDF Subset Service to extract datasets based on longitude/latitude and calendar date extents. The Unidata NetCDF-Java library, which underlies the TDS, also supports many client applications (e.g. Unidata IDV, Matlab NCTOOLBOX, University of Reading NcWMS, NASA Panoply).</p><p>This project aims to create a unified framework for IOOS model data by: a) extending  Unidata’s NetCDF-Java library and THREDDS Data Server (TDS) to fully support the  unstructured grid models, b) implementing support for Object Storage (such as Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage), and c) aiding in the installation and testing of the new services among data providers.</p><p>As of September 20th, 2021, TDS version 5.0 was released, the first version of the TDS to include Object Storage support. This was a critical component of the proposed framework and a significant milestone, enabling the TDS to serve model output from an AWS S3 bucket. </p><p>Development on native unstructured grid support in the NetCDF-Java library and TDS is nearing completion, but still requires extensive testing and evaluation, both internally and from end users and data providers. </p><p>The capstone goal of this project is to support users with deployment and implementation of the new technologies, which rely on the latest major release of the TDS. Throughout the transition, Unidata developers have received direct feedback and made iterative improvements to the framework. The next minor release of the TDS is now scheduled for May 2022 and will provide improved stability from the initial release. The following release, expected by the end of 2022, will contain feature-complete Object Store support as well as fully integrated unstructured grids into the technical stack, bringing long-needed functionality to the IOOS community.</p>"

            "model_desc": "<h3>WCOFS:</h3><p>The objective of the WCOFS project is to develop a state-of-the-science operational coastal ocean circulation data assimilation (DA) and forecast system for the entire U.S. West Coast, providing daily updates of 3-day forecasts of shelf currents, temperature, sea level and other variables in support of many societally-relevant needs, including navigation, search and rescue, environmental hazard response, fisheries, and public health. The model, based on the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS), spans coastal waters to about 1,000 km offshore of the Pacific coast of North America, from 24N (mid Baja California, Mexico) to 55N (north of Vancouver Island, Canada). The model’s horizontal resolution is 2 km. Atmospheric forcing is obtained from the 12-km resolution NOAA North American Model (NAM) forecast model. Boundary conditions are provided by the 1/12th-degree NOAA Real-Time Ocean Forecast System (RTOFS) global model, with tides added along open boundaries. The model includes freshwater discharge from several major rivers in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). The skill of the non-DA model has been assessed using a 6-year run and observations of sea level from coastal gauges, HF RADAR surface currents, ARGO float temperature (T) and salinity (S) profiles, surface T from buoys, satellite sea-surface temperature (SST), and glider T and S sections (Kurapov et al., 2017a,b). The non-DA model has been transitioned to operational implementation at the NOAA/NOS/CO-OPS and is being run on a supercomputer at NOAA’s National Center for Environmental Prediction (NOAA/NCEP). The WCOFS’ DA component, currently in operational implementation testing at NOS/CO-OPS, uses a coarser 4-km resolution grid, with interpolation to the model’s 2-km grid, due to the heavy computational burden of DA. The WCOFS DA system will utilize ROMS 4D-Var and assimilate observations of HF RADAR surface currents, sea-level anomaly from satellite altimeters, and SST to improve forecast accuracy of currents and SST fronts. The goals are (a) to enhance the WCOFS system and (b) to evaluate and use WCOFS output for established needs of three adjacent RAs.</p><p><h3>Data Assimilation</h3><p>DA, a critical component of analysis and forecast systems in operational numerical weather prediction (NWP), is now a mainstay in many operational centers for the ocean as well. Most operational centers that run global ocean analysis and forecast systems, including federal agencies and intergovernmental organizations, employ a variety of DA approaches: ensemble optimal interpolation, ensemble Kalman filters (EnKF), and 3-dimensional variational (3D-Var) methods (Martin et al., 2015). Ocean analysis and forecast systems are also run at regional scales (Edwards et al., 2015) with many near real-time examples run routinely by IOOS RAs (Kourafalou et al., 2015; Oke et al., 2015). With computational demands for regional systems typically being less than for global systems, employed DA methods range from 3D-Var, to EnKF to 4D-Var methods.</p><p>DA is also a critical component of WCOFS, in terms of 1) producing the best possible analyses as a synthesis of the model and all available observations and 2) producing the best starting point for forecasts. During the last decade Team Member Moore has led development of a state-of-the-science 4D-Var DA system for the ROMS community (Moore et al., 2011a,b,c). The ROMS 4D-Var system has been used in many regions of the world’s oceans (e.g., the Indian Ocean, the Philippine Sea, the Santos Basin, the Tyrrhenian Sea, the Gulf of Alaska, the Intra-Americas Sea, the entire North Atlantic, the Norwegian Sea, the East Australia Current) and, perhaps most extensively, along the U.S. West Coast (e.g., Broquet et al., 2009, 2010; Moore et al., 2013; Neveu et al., 2016). In addition, ROMS 4D-Var is currently run within three RAs (CeNCOOS, MARACOOS, and PacIOOS) in near-real time in support of IOOS. Because WCOFS employs the community version of ROMS, it too uses this advanced 4D-Var system.</p><p>At U.C. Santa Cruz (UCSC), a regional ocean analysis and forecast system has been developed and, since 2011, has run every day in support of CeNCOOS to produce near real-time, publicly available ocean state estimates (http://oceanmodeling.ucsc.edu). Though spanning a smaller geographic domain than WCOFS and run at significantly lower horizontal resolution (~10 km), analyses (1980 to the present), produced by the CeNCOOS 4D-Var system have proved to be a very valuable community resource. These analyses are used in a wide variety of studies, ranging from climate variability (Crawford et al., 2017), to juvenile rockfish recruitment (Schroeder et al., 2015), and to marine mammal migration patterns (Becker et al., 2017). As part of this project, technical advances that exist within the CeNCOOS 4D-Var system (UCSC ROMS) but not in the WCOFS 4D-Var system will be transitioned to WCOFS.</p><h3>Biogeochemical Modeling</h3><p>Although physical ocean models provide critical information for temperature, salinity, transport and mixing, there exists considerable demand for non-physical oceanographic information as well. Expert panels within the Global Ocean Observing System have defined one useful set of Essential Ocean Variables (EOVs; www.goosocean.org/eov) that include phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass and diversity, nutrients, inorganic carbon, particulate matter, and oxygen. In other advanced regional and global ocean analyses, lower trophic level BGC models are used to provide this complementary ecological information (Ciavatta et al., 2016; Jones et al., 2016; Ford et al., 2017).</p><p>For several years, CeNCOOS has supported BGC modeling within UCSC ROMS described above, first using a simple NPZD model then, more recently, the NEMURO ecosystem model (Kishi et al., 2007). The latter model performed well in the evaluation studies (Mattern et al., 2017a) and in those performed as part of the now expiring COMT 2013-2018 project. In its base form, NEMURO has 11-components, including nitrogen- and silicon-based nutrients, two phytoplankton size classes, and three zooplankton size classes. Plankton diversity allows representation of different communities, which vary in nature from diatom-dominated nearshore waters to predominantly smaller organisms found in more-oligotrophic offshore zones. Team Member Fiechter has enhanced the base NEMURO model to include dissolved inorganic carbon, alkalinity, and calcium carbonate (Fiechter et al., 2014) and, more recently, oxygen, based on the formulation in Fennel et al. (2006).</p><p>While considerable research effort has been spent over decades constructing and improving biogeochemical models (these efforts should and will continue), it is important to recognize that all models are necessarily imperfect, due to many unavoidable factors: uncertainties in initial conditions, boundary conditions, surface forcing, and model parameterizations. Consequently, unconstrained model output deviates from nature. As with physical fields, DA provides a rigorous approach to constrain biogeochemical model output using observations. Over the last five years, Team Member Edwards has led development of a ROMS 4D-Var DA system for BGC models (Song et al., 2012, 2016a,b,c), and our ability to perform BGC ocean state estimation constrained by satellite-derived chlorophyll using NEMURO is quite mature within the CeNCOOS domain (Mattern et al., 2017a, b). Furthermore, our procedure is robust, ready to assimilate other BGC variables as new data types (e.g., oxygen) become available.</p><p>The WCOFS project has long envisioned incorporating a BGC modeling capability to further support ecological forecasting applications, but, at present, does not have a BGC component. As part of this project, we will develop a WCOFS NEMURO system that produces multiple water column EOVs and make progress toward a WCOFS 4D-Var BGC ocean state estimate.</p><h3>California-Harmful Algae Risk Mapping (C-HARM)</h3><p>Domoic acid poisoning in marine mammal and bird populations, along with the threat of Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning in humans, is considered to be the leading harmful algal bloom (HAB) issue for much of the U.S. West Coast. A coherent approach to developing predictive capabilities for integrated environmental assessments, early warning systems, action plans, and mitigation strategies for these toxigenic Pseudo-nitzschia blooms was established at the West Coast Governors Alliance Harmful Algal Bloom Summit in 2009 (Lewitus et al., 2012) and then re-energized as part of NOAA’s Ecological Forecasting Roadmap.</p><p>In response to the call for a predictive HAB capability in California to better inform management decisions, Team Members Anderson and Kudela developed the C-HARM System to inform when and where toxic blooms occur. During Phase 1 of the NASA-funded C-HARM project, the team successfully generated and validated routine nowcast and forecast products in a pre-transitional demonstration of predictions of toxigenic Pseudo-nitzschia blooms and domoic acid along the central California coast. Statistical ecological models are driven by information from ocean model simulations, enhanced satellite imagery, and community (Cal-HABMAP)/marine mammal observations (Anderson et al. 2016). In the present C-HARM implementation, physical oceanographic information derives from a 3-km resolution, quasi-operational, 3D-Var DA model developed by Dr. Yi Chao that spans the entire California coast (CA ROMS; Li et al., 2008; Chao et al. 2017) and is provided, with support from CeNCOOS and SCCOOS, by a commercial operations provider (Remote Sensing Solutions, Inc.). Optical parameters required by the ecological models are retrieved and processed from satellite data (presently daily 1-km MODIS-Aqua data).</p><p>CeNCOOS has served as the C-HARM pre-operational decision-making environment, with everything from satellite data processing to product distribution implemented in-house. A close partnership has been established with NOAA’s NOS National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) to test the new data product on developmental computers. The C-HARM application has now transitioned to a demonstration readiness level within the end-user domain, hosted on NOAA’s high-performance computing (HPC) cluster, the Supercomputer for Satellite Simulations and Data Assimilation Studies (SSEC). The C-HARM capability is currently migrating to operational implementation at the NOAA CoastWatch West Coast Regional Node in partnership with NOAA/NOS/NCCOS.</p><p>As part of this project, we will initially evaluate C-HARM using historical WCOFS output and, if promising, will transition the end-to-end system at NOAA CoastWatch to using the operational WCOFS for its forecast product (See DiGiacomo LOS and Garfield LOS).</p><h3>Habitat Modeling Background</h3><p>NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service West Coast Regional Office (NMFS/WCRO), which is responsible for implementing U.S. West Coast fisheries management, is tasked with simultaneously maintaining target species catch at sustainable levels, reducing bycatch of protected and non-target species, and supporting the economic health of a fishery. Balancing these multiple and often opposing objectives is a complex management problem. For example, the California Drift Gillnet fishery (DGN) primarily targets broadbill swordfish (Xiphias gladius) in Federal waters off California, but bycatch of endangered species, such as the North Pacific loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea) turtles, have resulted in large-scale fishery closures that are enacted seasonally (leatherback turtles) and for June-August when an El Niño event is occurring or forecast to occur (loggerhead turtles). In making these decisions, the Pacific Fisheries Management Council (PFMC) and the NOAA/NMFS Southwest Regional Office are currently forced to consider coarse, often single-species, management approaches, without considering why interactions occurred where they did or where interactions are likely to occur in the future. Additionally, they are unable to consider whether this closure would increase bycatch of other species due to relocated fishing effort or the effects of the closure on fishers’ livelihoods. These missing considerations are not a result of the PFMC or NMFS lack of desire to explicitly consider these components; rather, they lack the tools to consider all of these pieces holistically.</p><p>Through projects previously and currently funded by NOAA and NASA, Team Member Hazen and collaborators have been developing a tool (EcoCast) to inform decision-makers for improved management strategies for the DGN fishery. EcoCast is based on statistical species distribution models (SDMs) developed for a number of swordfish fishery target and bycatch species of interest. These models, constructed using boosted regression trees (BRTs; Redfern et al. 2006, Wood 2008), describe the preferred habitats of target and bycatch species by statistically relating fisheries data (observer, satellite tracking, and logbook data) to concurrent oceanographic data. Target catch and bycatch SDMs are then normalized according to management risk and merged to create a single EcoCast product that predicts the relative probability of target catch and bycatch across the fishery landscape. A swordfish SDM has already been developed using the above approach (Scales et al., 2017) and a manuscript describing the EcoCast tool is now in review (Hazen et al., in review).</p><p>At present, EcoCast statistical models use either remotely-sensed data or output from the CeNCOOS-supported UCSC 4D-Var system. As part of this project, we will evaluate EcoCast’s relative performance when using WCOFS output versus the other sources presently in use.</p><h4>References</h4><p>Anderson C.R., R.M. Kudela, M.

NOAA’s National Ocean Service, Coast Survey Development Laboratory (CSDL) is developing the West Coast Ocean Forecasting System (WCOFS), a high-resolution ocean model spanning coastal and offshore waters relevant to all three RAs. The WCOF’s first implementation is presently in transition to operations within the National Ocean Service Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services. The goals of this project are (1) to advance coastal ocean modeling, analysis, and prediction through enhancements to the WCOFS model and (2) to transition established products relevant to NOAA’s Ecological Forecasting Roadmap to using WCOFS output. The vision is an advanced, operational, federal ocean model for the U.S. West Coast that supports locally generated, regionally relevant derivative ocean products required by end-users.</p><p>We propose several objectives for achieving these goals and contributing to this overall vision. This project will:</p><p>(a) assess WCOFS output using RA-developed metrics,</p><p>b) contribute specific technical developments to the WCOFS data assimilation implementation,</p><p>(c) couple WCOFS to a lower-trophic level, biogeochemical model with phytoplankton and zooplankton diversity and oxygen as state variables, transition a mature Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) probability model to produce 3-day forecasts using WCOFS output, and</p><p>(d) evaluate WCOFS output for use in a fast, efficient habitat model for swordfish and protected species bycatch.</p><p>To facilitate transition to operations, around the end of each Project Year we will hold workshops with key CSDL personnel to communicate technical details and assist in issues arising from implementation. To maximize product value (research to applications), we will organize a stakeholder outreach meeting early in the project to discuss WCOFS-related products with end-users, receive feedback, and enable modifications to implementation plans.<p/><p>Specific benefits of the improved WCOFS implementation include short-term operational HAB predictions across large swaths of the U.S. west coast and dynamic swordfish species and bycatch maps. These products benefit stakeholders within three IOOS RAs, including marine mammal rescue organizations, shellfish growers, and fisheries and coastal resource managers. The improved ocean state estimates will have potentially broad future impacts for a host of other societal needs, including navigation, search and rescue, and environmental hazard response.</p><p><a href=\"/docs/ConnectingStakeholderstoEcosystemChangewithEcologicalForecastModels.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Connecting Stakeholders to Ecosystem Change with Ecological Forecast Models</a>"

The Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) is committed to helping facilitate the latter by engaging with the team to improve understanding of National Ocean Service (NOS) requirements for potentially transitioning the modeling system to operations within NOAA. </p><p>Our existing Chesapeake Bay Environmental Forecasting System (CBEFS; vims.edu/hypoxia) is based on an open-source community model (an implementation of the Regional Ocean Modeling System) and provides nowcasts and forecasts of salinity, temperature, hypoxia, and pH. Input from our Stakeholder Focus Group meetings has revealed that these forecasts have proven very useful to end-users whose livelihoods depend on the Chesapeake Bay: information on hypoxia helps guide anglers to productive fishing grounds and information on pH can help aquaculturists and oyster hatchery operators decide when to delay spawning and avoid supplying spawning tanks with Bay intake water when water quality is poor. However, feedback from these stakeholders and local managers indicates that they require additional information including nowcasts and forecasts of harmful biotic events, so they can assess health threats and make decisions on beach closures or avoid harvesting shellfish when HABs are present.</p><p>Based on this feedback, we propose a multi-faceted effort that will (1) address multiple coastal modeling challenges with a new high-resolution version of CBEFS resulting in improved forecasts of our primary environmental variables, (2) use output from CBEFS to improve, validate, and verify the utility of existing Vibrio and HAB habitat suitability models, thus specifically providing the additional forecasts that have been directly requested by our stakeholders and (3) establish a prototype alert system that will send automated alerts when thresholds for the probable occurrence of these noxious organisms are present. All model results will be quantitatively evaluated via comparison with independent cruise and mooring data, and skill will be compared to the existing Chesapeake Bay Operational Forecast System (CBOFS) and with our previous COMT implementations. To ensure end users are inherently involved in the continuing development and design of our operational management tools, we will work in partnership with extension specialists to continue conducting Stakeholder Focus Group meetings to receive feedback on the format and content of the forecasts directly from our end users. Continuing to work closely with our operational hosts at MARACOOS, NCCOS and NOS will ensure that our forecasts are transitioned to operational readiness in a timely and efficient manner.</p>"

The model has a well-established and growing group of stakeholders including commercial, tribal, and recreational shellfish and crab fishers, public health managers, scientists, and students.  The mature state of the model, and the foreseeable retirement of its lead developer, make this an ideal time to train new operators and transition the system to NANOOS.</p><p>The realistic numerical model used here is created using the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS), which integrates the equations of motion and tracer concentration on a rotating, spherical grid.  The LiveOcean domain covers all of Oregon, Washington, and Vancouver Island coastal waters, and the Salish Sea – the name for the combined inland waters of Puget Sound, Strait of Georgia, and Strait of Juan de Fuca.  The model grid follows lines of constant longitude and latitude, with 500 m spacing in most of the Salish Sea and Washington coastal estuaries, stretching up to 3 km at open boundaries.  There are 30 vertical levels, following the bathymetry and free surface.  The model is configured to be as realistic as possible, with 45 rivers, 8 tidal constituents, open ocean conditions from a global data-assimilative model (HYCOM), and high-resolution (1.4 km) atmospheric forcing from a regional weather forecast model.  The model builds upon prior realistic configurations focused inside of the Salish Sea and on the open coast.  The model system includes biogeochemical fields: nitrate, phytoplankton, zooplankton, two sizes of detritus, oxygen, dissolved inorganic carbon, and alkalinity, developed as part of several large, multidisciplinary field programs.  Details of the model setup and extensive validation against observations are given in MacCready et al. (2021).  Typical root-mean-square errors (RMSE) between model and observations are 31 cm for sea surface height, 0.97 psu for salinity, 0.73 °C for temperature, and 1.09 mg L-1 for dissolved oxygen (DO).

            "sub_project_desc": "<h3>Multi-resolution ROMS 4D-Var</h3><p>We propose a multi-resolution approach for ROMS 4D-Var facilitated by a new feature in ROMS that allows different grid resolution NL, TL and AD components of 4D-Var run as separate executables. This “split” capability was introduced as part of the integration of ROMS into the Joint Effort for Data Assimilation Integration (JEDI). <br><br>Model-data misfits, or the so-called “innovations” in DA parlance, are computed based on a high-resolution NL model forecast with the most accurate possible physics, but the AD and TL iterations that collectively comprise the bulk of the compute effort run at a lower resolution. The low-resolution increments are interpolated back to the fine resolution model to execute the forecast.</p><h3>Mixed-precision 4D-Var in the multi-resolution system </h3><p>Most earth system models are written in double-precision yet research in Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) suggests that many floating-point operations can be performed at lower accuracy without an appreciable degradation in the final product. In applications where performance is limited by memory and or I/O, such as 4D-Var, the savings for large ocean grids may be substantial.<br><br>In mixed-precision ROMS, the outer loops are computed at double-precision for accuracy in the ocean dynamics, but the inner loops that inform the iterative search directions of the cost function minimization run at single precision. This will be tested in the MARACOOS and CeNCOOS systems and WCOFS re-run at UC Santa Cruz. In combination with the multi-resolution 4D-Var approach described above, the use of mixed-precision could potentially yield an order of magnitude reduction in the computational effort required to perform a 4D-Var analysis.</p><h3>Time- and space-averaged observations</h3><p>Altimetry, gilders, and coastal HF radars provide high temporal resolution observations to IOOS forecast systems. Direct assimilation of these raw data streams, however, can degrade the performance of 4D-Var if the cost function is dominated by high-frequency signals that are not well resolved by the model. An alternative approach is to assimilate the time-average of the observations, or in case of altimetry, observations that are pre-processed to best represent slowly evolving geophysical signals. The existing ROMS observation operators are not configured to accept time-averaged data, so we will develop a more general operator in the TL model forcing to allow the assimilation of such data.</p><h3>Ecosystem/BGC modeling with WCOFS</h3><p>One impediment to the development of ecosystem forecast models is the time and expertise required to configure a skillful underlying physical model, especially with DA. The ROMS 4D-Var systems in the RAs and at CSDL each took years to develop. We will create an infrastructure to quickly and easily re-run WCOFS analyses and forecasts locally, and with this explore how to leverage efforts in DA model development in support of ecosystem modeling.</p><h3>ROMS 4D-Var sandbox</h3><p>Creating a cloud-based sandbox for experimentation with ROMS 4D-Var DA is central to our project transition activities. The IOOS Cloud Sandbox (ICS) (github.com/ioos/Cloud-Sandbox) presently enables re-running selected instances of NOAA operational forecast systems and RA systems. <br><br>In collaboration with RPS, we will add to the ICS archival instances (not NRT sustained data) of MARACOOS and WCOFS 4D-Var encompassing all necessary code and supporting input files. This will enable researchers to explore the sensitivity of WCOFS (and MARACOOS) 4D-Var to changes in the 4D-Var configuration, but more importantly to changes in the assimilated data. This might include the impact of new data streams that are not yet operational or, via Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSE), the potential value of novel observing platforms or redesign of deployment strategies.</p><h4>References</h4><p>Kishi, M.J., Kashiwai, M., Ware, D.M., Megrey, B.A., Eslinger, D.L., Werner, F.E., Noguchi-Aita, M., Azumaya, T., Fujii, M., Hashimoto, S. and Huang, D., 2007.

The model uses an unstructured grid-based Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM; Chen et al., 2003) for hydrodynamics and an externally coupled model for biogeochemical water-quality kinetics (FVCOM-ICM; Kim and Khangaonkar, 2011). The model domain includes the Salish Sea basins of Puget Sound, the Strait of Juan De Fuca, and Georgia Basin, coastal waters around Vancouver Island, and the continental shelf from Canada’s Queen Charlotte Strait to Oregon’s Waldport (south of Yaquina Bay) as shown in Figure 1 The model also includes the Lower Columbia River and estuary up to Bonneville Dam and the Willamette River up to the Willamette Falls. The model has been extensively tested against monitoring data and has an established a good performance track record in large-scale computing exchange between the Salish Sea and the Pacific Ocean, overall circulation and inter-basin transport, and biogeochemical cycles, including DO and pH response to nutrient loading (Ahmed et. al. 2019, Khangaonkar et. al. 2017, 2018, 2019, and Khangaonkar et. al. 2021). <br><br>For use in operational forecasts by NOS, we determined that a 10-fold increase in resolution was needed, ranging from 50-100m cell size along the shoreline increasing to 200-400 m in Puget Sound to 400-1000 in the Straits to a 3 km resolution on the outer shelf. This would ensure that fine-scale phenomena such as eddies resulting from complex shoreline features, river mouths, or near the confluence of inner sub-basins, intertidal wetting and drying, and spatial gradients induced by shoreline complexity and islands were reproduced accurately. The model SSM-OFS was set up for three selected years; 2015, 2016, and 2017 based on the availability of a large currents data set produced by an ADCP survey program conducted by NOAA covering Puget Sound, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and the San Juan Islands regions of the Salish Sea within U.S. waters. The model forcing and setup procedures are similar to those previously described in Khangaonkar et al., (2019 and 2021). This includes freshwater inflows to the Salish sea from 26 major gauged rivers, 135 ungauged streams estimated through hydrological analysis, and 99 wastewater water outfalls. Meteorological forcing inputs were obtained from the Weather Forecasting Research (WRF) model’s reanalysis data generated by the University of Washington for 2015 and 2016. The conditions at the open ocean boundary were extracted from the HYCOM (HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model; Wallcraft et al., 2009) and reanalysis data at the nodal locations of the outer boundary. <br><br>The performance of the model was tested through comparison with measurements of water surface level (WSE), temperature (T), salinity (S), and currents. The observations for WSE were gathered from 13 water level stations in the Salish Sea domain from National Water Level Observation Network (NWLON), which is maintained by NOAA CO-OPS. The model skill in capturing the freshwater mixing and the estuarine exchange was tested against the measurements for T and S, obtained from 21 monitoring stations maintained by the Washington Department of Ecology. The currents were from the  NOAA CO-OPS ADCP survey of Puget Sound mentioned previously.

(a) Tides monitoring stations maintained by NOAA on the coast of Washington and inner Salish Sea ‘*’ (b) monthly monitoring stations maintained by the Washington State Department of Ecology (green triangles), and (c) NOAA ADCP stations (colored circles by the year) </p><p>Quantitative model skill assessment was conducted using National Ocean Service (NOS) procedures described in “User-based skill assessment techniques for operational hydrodynamic forecast systems' paper by Zhang et. al. (2010). Statistical parameters in the NOS skill assessment include the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Central Frequency (CF) as key indicators of model performance. CF is defined as the percentage fraction of errors that lie within the predefined error limit. Results indicate that  > 90% of the time, the model is within the defined error limit for WSE of (10 – 12) % of the tidal range at the selected stations. <br><br>Skill assessment for currents was conducted using the ADCP data. The RMSE values for velocity magnitudes satisfy the NOS criteria (< 0.26 m/s) for all three years, while the CF remains close to 90 % in both 2015 and 2016. Also, the model has been able to capture the phase of the barotropic currents relatively well, although the model scores are below the NOS benchmarks (RMSE < 36 ° and CF > 90%). The phase differences between the model-predicted and observed currents are attributed to the smoothing and bottom-roughness adjustments introduced to retain the appropriate vertical stratification, salinity gradients, and the accuracy of the resulting exchange flow. Overall model performance of predicting temperature and salinity in the form of error statistics at all stations was found to be comparable to the validation results as recorded in (Khangaonkar et al., 2021), with domain wide average temperature root-mean-square errors <0.73 °C, and salinity root-mean-square errors < 1.26 PSU.</p><h3>SSCOFS:</h3><p>While the SSM-OFS focuses on the inner Salish Sea geographical region, the model domain extends to the continental shelf boundary and includes several major coastal estuaries, including the Columbia River and its estuary, extending from the Bonneville Dam to its mouth near Astoria, OR. Although CO-OPS already maintains a Columbia River Estuary Operational Forecast System (CREOFS), it is based on a modeling framework that is no longer supported by NOAA. Successful development of the SSM-OFS has led to the decision to continue this work through the addition of the Columbia River to the SSM-OFS. Focusing on Columbia River-specific data acquisition and synthesis, iterative model refinement, skill assessment, and reporting, the project has resulted in a system that combines both domains into the SSCOFS. Relative to the baseline SSM, the SSCOFS model may be regarded as approximately 12-fold higher resolution Salish Sea Model with an embedded representation of the Lower Columbia River, also at a compatible higher resolution.<br><br>Figure 3 shows the evolution of the original Columbia River grid from SSM, to the intermediate refined version, and the final version of the Columbia River region of SSCOFS model grid. In parallel with grid refinement, the existing bathymetry (originally from the Eastern North Pacific ADCIRC model grid) was also updated using a more detailed and updated bathymetry provided by NOAA from the CREOFS.<br><br><img style='width: 600px;display: block;margin: auto;' class='img-responsive img-thumbnail' src='/images/comt/salish-sea-new.png' /><p class='caption'>Figure 3: Evolution of Columbia River estuary region of the Salish Sea Model (a) Original placeholder coarse scale grid in SSM, (b) Intermediate refinement as part of the SSM-OFS model version grid, and (c) Final version of refinement implemented in SSCOFS model. </p><p>The SSCOFS was setup for 2017 as that was the first year with NOAA operational products data (HRRR meteorological forcing and GRTOFS ocean boundary) available for testing. River flows were specified using the NOAA National Water Model (NWM). Tidal constituents for the SSCOFS model were obtained from the ENPAC database and default values of river temperatures provided by the Washington State Department of Ecology were used for specifying Columbia River and Willamette River temperatures. <br><br>As part of skill assessment, we compared predicted WSE with data from 7 NOAA CO-OPS stations, and predicted S and T with data from 8 CMOP stations. Figure 4 shows the locations of the CMOP stations in blue and CO-OPS stations are shown in yellow. The skill assessment for WSE was conducted using NOAA procedures (Zhang et al. 2010., 2006). <br><br></p><img style='width: 600px;display: block;margin: auto;' class='img-responsive img-thumbnail' src='/images/comt/salish-sea-2.png' /><p class='caption'>Figure 4. NOAA CO-OPS monitoring stations for WSE (7) and CMOP monitoring stations for salinity and temperature (8) used in the Columbia River model performance and skill assessment. </p><p>Figure 5 below shows the comparison between the predicted WSE (blue) and observation data (red).  Results show that the estuary and lower parts of the Columbia River domain have higher model skills compared to the upper reaches. In addition, the model simulates high flow better compared to low flow. The reason could be that a high friction coefficient was needed to achieve the high flow WSE peak which also tends to retain water in the channel slowing the drainage. We expect fine-tuning the bathymetric resolution and spatial variation of bed friction could be used to improve the SA results.<br><br>Skill assessment results for the Columbia River domain indicate that RMSE levels are below 0.15 m at all stations except for the Vancouver and Saint Heles. The Series Mean (SM) or bias varies between -0.06 to 0.07 m. While the SM and RMSE metrics in general look good/reasonable the CF at most stations varies between 80-90% and is lower in the upper reaches of Longview, St. Helens, and Vancouver. However, based on our discussions with the NOAA CO-OPS team we understand that this performance is comparable to, or improves over, the existing CREOFS. Clearly, there is room for further improvement but it may require further model refinement and may come at the cost of computational efficiency. </p><img style='width: 600px;display: block;margin: auto;' class='img-responsive img-thumbnail' src='/images/comt/salish-sea-3.png'<p class='caption'>Figure 5 The comparison of predicted WSE (blue) and measured data (red)from the NOAA CO-OPS stations in the Columbia River region of SSCOFS.

                "text": "<p>The Salish Sea is located on the Pacific Northwest coast of North America, spanning Puget Sound in Washington, USA, in the south, to the Georgia basin in British Columbia, Canada, to the north. The domain includes several Straits and Islands. This is a rapidly growing region that supports significant maritime commerce, and ship traffic which is expected to increase continuously in the coming years. In addition, the Salish Sea receives wastewater discharges from 99 wastewater outfalls from major cities, including Seattle, Tacoma, Everett, and Bellingham, in US and Victoria and Vancouver in Canada. In recent years millions of gallons of untreated wastewater have been accidentally discharged directly into Puget Sound due to overload and equipment failure. These events along with increased risk associated with potential maritime accidents and spills have resulted in heightened community-wide interest in real-time oceanographic information. Current predictions with sufficient spatial resolution and accuracy are needed for use in risk management from exposure to potential spills and in support of navigation and maritime emergency response. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/ National Ocean Services (NOAA/NOS) identified the Salish Sea region of the Pacific Northwest as a major data gap and the development of an Operational Forecast System (OFS) for the Salish Sea has become a high priority. In addition to NOAA mission goals and priorities related to navigation, the annually recurring hypoxic events, exposure of shellfish farms to corrosive waters, seasonal harmful algal blooms, occurrences of shellfish poisoning, and exposure to wastewater and stormwater, are ecosystem management related challenges faced by the communities that need and would benefit from realtime information from an OFS for this Salish Sea region.<br><br>The objective of this COMT project is to transition the Salish Sea Model (SSM) developed by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to an operational forecast system status, to be maintained by NOS, following major improvements in the form of grid resolution refinement and detailed skill assessment to reach the required readiness level. One obstacle to refinement and the development of a shoreline resolving intertidal scale model has been the lack of current measurements with sufficient coverage which could be used for robust model validation and testing. New acoustic doppler current profile (ADCP) data collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) from 135 stations in the Salish Sea over the years 2015 to 2017 fully addressed this data gap. The COMT project supported by this data set has led to the development of a high-resolution version of the coupled hydrodynamic and biogeochemical SSM. This was initially named “Salish Sea Model-Operational Forecast System (SSM-OFS)”. The SSM-OFS with a 10-fold increase in grid resolution and successful completion of testing using NOAA operational products and NOS skill assessment procedures demonstrated a readiness level for transition to operational status. As an additional part of this effort, the development and testing of the SSM Biogeochemical Model for potential application in Ecosystem Forecasting using the hydrodynamic files generated by SSM-OFS have also been completed.<br><br>In the third and final year of the COMT project, the objective of the project was amended. The NOAA-COOPS currently maintains a Columbia River Estuary Operational Forecast System (CREOFS). NOS expressed interest in upgrading and consolidating the Columbia River domain into one of the existing larger domain OFSs. Given the complexity of the Columbia River estuary shoreline, NOS requested that the Columbia River domain be included in SSM-OFS based on its similar unstructured grid finite volume formulation and funded the effort independently through the regional association NANOOS. The resulting model is the Salish Sea & Columbia River Operational Forecast System (SSCOFS), which has also achieved a readiness level for transition to NOS. The SSCOFS, in addition to the Salish Sea, incorporates 146 miles of Lower Columbia River domain from Astoria, OR at the mouth, to Bonneville Dam.<br><br>Operational forecast results are not yet ready. However, the transition of SSCOFS to NOS is underway. SSCOFS files have been transferred to NOAA-COOPs where they are being installed on the NOAA Coastal Ocean Modeling Framework (COMF) for testing and finalization.<br><br>Figure 1 below shows the overall SSCOFS domain (inset) along with a close up of the Salish Sea region.

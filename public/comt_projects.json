Although the mean nitrogen budget of the Chesapeake Bay has been previously estimated from observations, uncertainties associated with interannually varying hydrological conditions remain. In this study, a land-estuarine-ocean biogeochemical modeling system is developed to quantify Chesapeake riverine nitrogen inputs, within-estuary nitrogen transformation processes and the ultimate export of nitrogen to the coastal ocean. Model skill was evaluated using extensive in situ and satellite-derived data, and a simulation using environmental conditions for 2001–2005 was conducted to quantify the Chesapeake Bay nitrogen budget. The five year simulation was characterized by large riverine inputs of nitrogen split roughly 60:40 between inorganic:organic components. Much of this was denitrified and buried within the estuarine system. A positive net annual ecosystemproduction for the bay further contributed to a large advective export of organic nitrogen to the shelf and negligible inorganic nitrogen export. Interannual variability was strong, particularly for the riverine nitrogen fluxes. In years with higher than average riverine nitrogen  inputs, most of this excess nitrogen (50–60%) was exported from the bay as organic nitrogen, with the remaining split between burial, denitrification, and inorganic export to the coastal ocean. In comparison to previous simulations using generic shelf biogeochemical model formulations inside the estuary, the estuarine biogeochemical model described here produced more realistic and significantly greater exports of organic nitrogen and lower exports of inorganic nitrogen to the shelf.</p><p><b>Collaborators:</b></p><p><b>Publications:</b></p><p><b>Datasets:</b><div class=\"list-group\"></div></p></div>",
            "model_desc": "<h3>Primary Chesapeake Bay Testbed models:</h3><h4 class=\"sub-project-title\">ChesROMS-SRM, ChesROMS -ECB, ChesROMS-BGC</h4><p>ChesROMS (<a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12237-011-9423-5\" target=\"_blank\">Xu et al. 2012</a>) is a community ocean modeling system for the Chesapeake Bay region, which is based on the Regional Ocean Modeling System (<a href=\"http://www.myroms.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ROMS</a>), with significant adaptations for the Chesapeake Bay. The model uses a curvilinear horizontal grid and a stretched terrain-following vertical grid with twenty vertical layers. The model was developed to provide a community modeling system for hindcasts, nowcasts and forecasts of 3D hydrodynamic circulation, temperature and salinity.</p><p>Multiple ecosystem/biogeochemical models have been coupled with ChesROMS. These include the Simple Respiration Model (SRM) which uses a constant respiration rate throughout the water column, as well as more sophisticated biogeochemical including including <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015JG002931/epdf\" target=\"_blank\">ChesROMS-ECB</a> and ChesROMS-BGC (see <a href=\"http://www.biogeosciences.net/13/2011/2016/\" target=\"blank\">Irby et al. 2016</a> for descriptions of these models.)</p><h4 class=\"sub-project-title\">CBOFS-SRM</h4><p>The ROMS-based Chesapeake Bay Operational Forecast System (CBOFS; Lanerolle et al., 2011) is the operational model run by the NOAA National Ocean Service. A major difference between ChesROMS and CBOFS is the horizontal grid resolution; ChesROMS has 100x150 cells with about 1 to 7 km resolution; CBOFS has 332x291 cells with about 0.03 to 4 km resolution. Results from CBOFS are available at: <a href=\"https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ofs/cbofs/cbofs.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ofs/cbofs/cbofs.html</a>. The Simple Respiration Model (SRM) has recently been coupled with CBOFS; these results are only available on a developmental version of the official CBOFS website.</p><h3>Additional Chesapeake Bay models:</h3><h4 class=\"sub-project-title\">ROMS-RCA</h4><p>Another ROMS-based model for the Chesapeake Bay has been independently developed and coupled to the Row-Column AESOP model (RCA; Testa et al., 2014). This version of ROMS (Li et al. 2005) is very similar to ChesROMS (including a similar horizontal resolution and number of vertical grid levels), but has slightly different hydrodynamic parameterizations and physical forcing.</p><h4 class=\"sub-project-title\">CH3D-ICM</h4><p>The Curvilinear Hydrodynamics in Three Dimensions model (CH3D; Cerco et al., 2010), is compared with the ChesROMS models described above in Irby et al. (2016). This model employs a z-grid and is used by the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program as part of their regulatory operational modeling framework. The horizontal grid of CH3D-ICM has significantly greater resolution than ChesROMS, and is more equivalent to that of CBOFS. CH3D is coupled to the Integrated Compartment Model (ICM), which is a complex biogeochemical modeling system.</p><h4 class=\"sub-project-title\">EFDC-SRM</h4><p>The Hydrodynamic-Eutrophication Model – Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) has been implemented for the Chesapeake Bay (Hong and Shen, 2012; Du and Shen, 2015), and also participated in the Chesapeake Bay Hypoxia Testbed comparison (Irby et al. 2016). The EFDC implementation used here is coupled to a version of the Simple Respiration Model (SRM).</p><h4 class=\"sub-project-title\">FVCOM-ICM</h4><p>The ChesROMS models were also compared with the Finite-Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM; Jiang and Xia, 2015). FVCOM employs an unstructured grid with ten vertical layers. Like CH3D, FVCOM is coupled to the ICM.</p>",

                "text": "<p>Hypoxia is a condition threatening the health of the Chesapeake Bay in which oxygen levels drop so low that fish and other animals are stressed or killed.  In the Bay, incidents of hypoxia-causing ‘dead zones’ are on the rise.</p><p>Hypoxia in Chesapeake Bay usually occurs in the summer and is primarily the result of human activities that deliver nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus into the Bay, although evidence from the testbed scientists suggest that wind forcing also plays a significant role. The added nutrients support surface blooms of algae, which eventually die, sink and are decomposed at the bottom of the Bay by oxygen-depleting bacteria. The resulting hypoxia can suffocate animals that cannot move away, such as shellfish, and — depending on how quickly the hypoxia develops — either kill or force into less suitable habitat free-swimming animals such as fish and crabs.</p><p>The Chesapeake Bay Testbed project is designed to provide a better understanding of the uncertainty inherent in predictions of properties such as salinity, temperature, chlorophyll, and nutrients; how this uncertainty contributes to the predictability of dissolved oxygen concentrations; and how to improve models of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in the Chesapeake Bay. Model intercomparisons have demonstrated that the regulatory model used by the EPA Chesapeake Bay Program performs as well as many of the research models currently being used by the scientific community, giving both Chesapeake Bay Program Managers and academic scientists more confidence in the regulatory model. An ensemble mean of multiple models was found to have higher skill predicting hypoxia than any individual model (<a href=\"http://www.biogeosciences.net/13/2011/2016/\" target=\"_blank\">Irby et al., 2016</a>), illustrating the potential value of multi-model ensembles for decision making in the Chesapeake Bay.</p><p>A simple one-term model for hypoxia was developed for use in operational forecasts and is currently providing nowcasts and 2-day forecasts of Chesapeake Bay hypoxia on the <a href=\"http://www.vims.edu/research/topics/dead_zones/forecasts/cbay/\" target=\"_blank\">Virginia Institute of Marine Science website</a>. Forecasts from more sophisticated hypoxia models are in the developmental stage and will soon also be available on this website, along with other fields relevant to Chesapeake stakeholders (temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, water clarity). Efforts to transition this tool to NOAA’s <a href=\"https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ofs/cbofs/cbofs.html\" target=\"_blank\">Chesapeake Bay Operational Forecast System (CBOFS)</a> and to the <a href=\"http://oceansmap.maracoos.org/\" target=\"_blank\">IOOS Mid-Atlantic Regional Association (MARACOOS) OceansMap</a> are ongoing. In a companion effort, the Chesapeake Hypoxia Testbed team has used multiple models to examine how nutrient load reductions will impact dissolved oxygen in the Chesapeake Bay, and has developed a method for quantifying the uncertainty associated with projected changes in hypoxia resulting from the implementation of these nutrient reductions. Ongoing work is focused on applying projected changes in temperature, freshwater flow, and sea level rise for a 2050 scenario to explore the impact climate change may have on future Chesapeake Bay hypoxia and the potential success of the nutrient reductions in attaining mandated estuarine water quality standards.</p><p>The results of this project are providing the modeling information that will enable best management practices and mitigation measures to be targeted on the human activities that have the most significant effect on decreasing nutrient transfer from land to coastal ecosystems in the region. Recent findings include (1) that the ChesROMS-1term model performs just as well when using nowcast forcing as it does when using hindcast forcing, (2) that ignoring precipitation/evaporation and underestimating riverine freshwater inputs may be causing a high salinity bias in the official version of CBOFS, (3) that nutrient load reduction scenarios conducted with both the regulatory EPA model and our ChesROMS-BGC research model confirm that both models predict similar improvements in bottom DO, and nearly identical water quality standards attainment, (4) the transition of the HYPOXIA_SRM (simple respiration model) to the official ROMS Ecosystem Branch.

Results will inform the interagency Hypoxia Task Force’s efforts to devise near-term and long-term nutrient management strategies. Open questions for nutrient management in the watershed are how far nutrient loads would have to be decreased in order to produce the significant reductions in Gulf of Mexico hypoxia, when these would be measurable given significant natural variability, and how global warming will affect the management goals. We have quantified the effects of differential reductions in river N and P loads on hypoxic extent. An assessment of the effects of N versus P reductions is important because, thus far, nutrient management efforts have focused on N, yet P is known to limit primary production in spring and early summer. Our results indicate that while N is the ‘ultimate’ limiting nutrient to primary production, temporary P limitation in spring plays a large role in determining areal hypoxic extent and cumulative hypoxic exposure. Reductions in either river N or P load would decrease hypoxic extent but combined reductions of N and P would have the greatest effect.</p><p><b>Collaborators:</b> Katja Fennel (Dalhousie), Arnaud Laurent (Dalhousie), Dong S.

Project objectives are to: (1) compile a data set of observations collected around Puerto Rico and the USVI by the IOOS Caribbean Regional Association; (2) evaluate multiple, coupled wave/surge/inundation models against this data; (3) recommend the most suitable model for transition to operations and (4) assist with the transition.  These outcomes will also be applicable to U.S. island regions in the Pacific and may therefore guide future implementations at NOAA’s Central Pacific Hurricane Center.</p><p>U.S. island regions in the Caribbean and Pacific pose many challenges to the accurate modeling and prediction of hazardous wave-dominated storm surge inundation events.  The relative importance of physical processes leading to inundation in steep-sloped, reef-edged island environments differs from those in milder-sloped mainland environments.  Relatively little research has been done in these environments, constituting a significant knowledge gap.  To compound this uncertainty, little observational data are available in many island environments.  As a result, the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) currently lacks operational surge and inundation guidance for these regions. An exception to this general data scarcity is Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI), which frequently experience strong tropical and extra-tropical storms resulting in high waves, storm surge, and river flooding.  A large number of observational instruments have been deployed here, many by IOOS Caribbean Regional Association partners, creating a valuable resource for the evaluation and advancement of operational wave/surge/inundation models of these areas.</p><p>Three teams – an operational assessment team (federal user group), a numerical modeling team and a data management team – will work together to accomplish the following tasks:\nModel, test case and metric selection: All teams jointly define desired operational inundation model improvements in Puerto Rico and USVI, and identify candidate models to meet those needs.  The data team selects test cases for model evaluation and compiles these into an islands inundation data set, compliant with the COMT’s Cyber-Infrastructure standards.  All teams jointly define a set of metrics for model evaluation and comparison.</p><p>Model comparison over reef transects: The modeling team performs detailed cross-reef simulations with coupled spectral wave and hydrodynamic models to evaluate performance on a physics process basis.  Results are compared with observations and against phase-resolving wave models (which are too expensive for operational use, but will provide useful benchmark results).</p><p>Model comparison for regional field cases:  The modeling team performs model evaluations over complex regional field cases, featuring hurricane meteorological forcing, high-resolution bathymetry and topography, roughness values derived from benthic maps and rainfall run-off inputs.  Model performance will be compared for accuracy and computational requirements.</p><p>Final evaluation, recommendations and dissemination: All teams will compile joint recommendations regarding the most suitable model or models for near-term and long-term operational implementation.  Recommendations will also be made regarding current and future observational networks and field campaigns.  All teams will provide assistance in the transition of the recommended model, incl. setting up COMET web-based training materials, if required.</p>"

Wave-current interaction created variations in the surge elevation in both space and time, with the more significant effects occurring over the shelf and open coast rather than inside the inner bays. Sea level change along the coast was mainly driven by barotropic dynamics; the highest vertically integrated water transports were essentially the same for cases with and without vertical stratification. However, wave-current interaction generated strong vertical current shear in some of the stratified areas, leading to a strong offshore transport near the bottom and vertical turbulent mixing over the continental shelf. Stratification could also result in a significant difference in current velocities around islands where the water is not vertically well-mixed.</p><p><b>Publications: </b>Yunfang Sun, Changsheng Chen, Robert C.

All three models showed comparable tidal accuracy and consistent dynamic responses to storm winds, both with and without the inclusion of wave effects. The three models also showed that wave-current interaction could (1) change the current direction on the shelf to the north of Scituate Harbor from along-shelf to onshore, thereby enlarging onshore water transport and (2) intensify an anticyclonic eddy in the harbor entrance and a cyclonic eddy in the harbor interior, which could push water inside the harbor toward the northern peninsula and the southern end and thus enhance flooding in those areas.</p><p><b>Publications: </b>Changsheng Chen, Robert C.

In all simulations, a wind driven coastal current flowed southward across the harbor entrance, with an attached separation eddy forming downstream of the northern breakwater and a rapid decrease of wave energy entering the harbor. With wave-current interaction, the southward coastal current was strongly enhanced and currents within the separation eddy increased to more than 1 m/s, making it highly nonlinear with large lateral shears. Comparisons of the model water elevation time series with harbor tide station measurements showed that wave-current interaction increased the peak model surge by ∼8 cm, in closer agreement with the observed peak.

The default/recommended setting for the wind input parameterization overestimated the maximum significant wave heights by about 2 m in the deep Gulf of Mexico when compared with observations from moorings. The overestimation could be relieved either by adjusting the maximum value of the surface drag coefficient or by substituting a high-wind-speed bulk formula for the default low-to-moderate one used in SWAN. Because of the dissipative effects of the shallow coastal areas, the overestimation of waves in deep water has limited impact on the waves in near-shore waters. Thus, previous wave model results using a low-to-moderate wind speed bulk formula may still be reliable in waters shallower than 20 m while overestimating significant wave heights in deeper waters for high wind speed conditions such as hurricanes.</p><p><b>Publications: </b>Huang, Y., R.H.

However, its large wind field in conjunction with the broad Louisiana-Texas shelf and large-scale concave coastal geometry generated waves and surge that impacted over 1000 km of coastline. Ike's complex and varied wave and surge response included: the development of a storm surge “forerunner” 24 h prior to the storm's landfall due to strong shore-parallel, wind-driven currents and the associated across-shelf, geostrophic setup; the resulting early rise of water in coastal bays and lakes facilitating inland surge penetration and inundation; the shore-normal wind-driven peak surge; the southward propagation of a free wave along the Texas shelf; and the appearance of resonant and reflected waves on the adjacent continental shelf. Preexisting and rapidly deployed instrumentation provided the most comprehensive hurricane response data set ever recorded. More than 91 wave parameter time histories, 523 water level time histories, and 206 high water marks were collected in deep water, in the near shore, and up to 65km inland.

Grid resolution requirements were found to be less stringent in the open ocean, however, coarse resolution or the absence of intratidal zones decreased solution accuracy along protected near shore and inland coastal areas due to decreased frictional attenuation. Diurnal tidal amplitudes were more sensitive to the presence of intratidal zones and coarse mesh resolution than semidiurnal tides. The bottom friction parameterization had little effect on tidal skill, however, it had a significant impact on the strength of the alongshore current generated during hurricane Ike and the magnitude of the resulting geostrophic setup (forerunner). Nonlinear advection increased the geostrophic set up by 15–20 cm and increased resonant shelf waves by 20–30 cm.

In addition, NWS's official operational forecast storm surge model, SLOSH, was used on both local (Galveston and Sabine Pass basins) and Gulf of Mexico (ETSS) grids. The three unstructured models yielded similar results for both hurricanes. These models all appeared to reproduce the important physical processes, showed minimal water level or wave height bias, and comparable variances versus observations. SLOSH using the Galveston Basin grid failed to capture the hurricane Ike forerunner and was therefore biased significantly low. SLOSH performed better on the Sabine Pass Basin grid for hurricane Rita, which did not elicit a significant forerunner. SLOSH on the ETSS grid showed minimal bias for either storm, although its accuracy was limited by the nearly 5 km resolution in near shore/onshore areas. In all cases, SLOSH deviations from observations were greater than those from the three unstructured grid models. The largest difference in model performance was observed in execution speed and scalability. The implicit time stepping scheme of SELFE+WWM performed well at small numbers of cores, but scaled poorly at larger numbers of cores. ADCIRC+SWAN had better scaling and absolute performance when more than 128 cores were used per run. SLOSH is not configured to utilize modern parallel computing architecture and rather is limited to running on a single core. Runtimes for ADCIRC on a single core were more than 10 times longer than for SLOSH on the ETSS grid, even after the SLOSH runtimes were normalize for the number of grid nodes. Thus, SLOSH remains more efficient for use in probabilistic forecasting based on large ensembles of model runs. However, SLOSH-based probabilistic forecasts should be assessed for accuracy (particularly high or low bias) by comparing select, individual SLOSH runs with similar runs using higher resolution unstructured grid models as presented herein.</p><p><b>Publications: </b>Kerr, P.

                "text": "<p>The cyberinfrastructure (CI) team is focused on facilitating data discovery and access.  Currently the CI team is developing a COMT landing page to be hosted at ioos.us.  This page will include an overview of COMT as a whole and individual project landing pages containing descriptions of the projects, associated archive data, and references.  Each project page will also link to individual dataset summary pages that provide basic information about the dataset and links for access.  The COMT team also manages the data repository using a THREDDS catalog.  This repository is populated by the PIs with the assistance of the CI team. A data upload tool has been developed to facilitate the process of providing data for the repository. The CI team also developed and hosts a map-based viewer that allows users to visualize and perform basic plotting and analysis of the COMT project data.  Finally, the CI team maintains and enhance sciWMS, a python WMS service for gridded data.  Planned enhancements for Year 4 include updated color schemes and scales as well as support for 3D cross-sections.</p>"
